You need Visual studio with c/c++ compiler
WE ONLY NEED LIB FILES, not DLL, we will always use STATIC binding, so the generated executeable will have the opus built in, without any extra libraries

libogg:
Run the .sln file in vs2010 folder for dynamin library, choose release, x64, and build

opus:
Run the .sln file in vs2015 folder for dynamin library, choose releasedll, x64, and build

opus-file:
this one a bit shit, you have to right click on opus-file project, then properties, c/c++, first one, add aditional include libraries, you have to include libogg folder, I have attached screen shot to help
make sure you select Release-NoHTTP, so we don't require openssl shit
You need to compile this project two times, I don't know why, but one change project type to static library, another dynamic library
if you choose dynamic library, you need to drag the two .libs files generated from the previous projects into the project, opus.lib libogg.lib, they are required for linker

libopusenc:
Run the .sln file in vs2015 folder for dynamin library, choose releasedll, x64, and build

of course, with every project, copy the dll and lib file to out lib folder
